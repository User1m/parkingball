## ParkingBall

Your crystal ball guide into parking availability where ever you want to go. #KnowBeforeYouGo

Many of us use a mapping service like Google Maps to get directions and plan out routes for
daily trips. In this current process, no thought is ever given to the parking aspects of our
trips. We just plan and hope that there will be parking spots available where ever our
destination is.

This leads to the common problem of trying to go to a popular destination, like downtown on a
Saturday night for a movie date with your girlfriend, arriving there and subsequently finding
no parking spots.

ParkingBall is a web application that prompts you to consider, amongst all the other things,
the availability of parking when planning out trips to destinations via other applications
like Google Maps.

By having the chrome extension installed, ParkingBall will determine how likely you are to
find parking where ever your destination is and advise you on what actions to take. For
example, if ParkingBall deems you are "very unlikely to find parking" it will suggest other
alternative modes of transportation to  take that same day. Or it will give you a suggestion
of a better time and day to visit that particular location.

In this app I created my own algorithm to take into account several factors such as
timeOfDay, weekDay, popularity of the destination, season, etc. and all those variables
factored in determine "how likely you are to get a parking spot".

ParkingBall - Your crystal ball guide into the availability of parking where ever your
destination is....So that you can know before you go.

ParkingBall aims to make parking in major cities like LA:

1. Less demanding
> > - it is our goal to provide users with the next best alternative form of transportation that
doesn't require parking

2. More usable
> > - users will prioritize parking in their daily trip planning
> > - and they'll be better able to predict the availability of parking
